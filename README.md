- If the number of players is less than 4, the players will be able to obtain at least 4 trample steams from the equipment table during the Maxis Trample Steams step, but they must place one down before being able to equip the next one. Zombies will ignore the Trample Steams placed during the step.

#### Sharpshooter
Minimum number of required targets:
- 1p: 20 targets (Candy Shop)
- 2p: 39 targets (Candy Shop + Saloon (19))
- 3p: the players can choose it to be either 61 targets (Candy Shop + Saloon + Barn (22)) or all targets. Shooting more than 65 targets on an attempt makes the step switch to check for if all targets are hit on that attempt.
